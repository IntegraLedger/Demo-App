# Integra Ledger Demo Application
The code is based on the Bluemix Getting started tutorial for Node.js uses this sample application to provide you with a sample workflow for working with any Node.js app on Bluemix; you set up a development environment, deploy an app locally and on Bluemix, and integrate a Bluemix database service in your app.

The Node.js app uses [Express Framework](https://expressjs.com) and [Cloudant noSQL DB service](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db) to add information to a database and then return information from a database to the UI. To learn more about how the app connects to Cloudant, see the [Cloudant library for Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudant).

We are not currently using the database but have left in the code for now.


The following steps are the general procedure to set up and deploy the app. See more detailed instructions in the [Getting started tutorial for Node.js](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/runtimes/nodejs/getting-started.html#getting-started-with-node-js-on-bluemix).

## Before you begin

You'll need a [Bluemix account](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

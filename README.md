# Integra Demo

API demonstration materials for Integra users and partners.

Please pardon our dust!  We are merging several variants of our demonstration projects into a single
place for easier digestion.

<b>This project is evolving, is subject to change.</b>

## Start Here
Most users will only need to review only a few files:
 * src/views/index.html __(You can load this immediately for a demo right now.)__
 * src/views/indexHandlers.js __(Handlers required by the above demo.)__
 * docs/integra-api.yaml __(NOTE: This is a Swagger description, requiring appropriate tools.)__
 * docs/integra-api-v0_0_1.html __(This is an HTML rendition of the above.)__

Please note that other files in this archive are being maintained for the convenience of their
current users, and that all new users should use that materials referenced above.  We expect to be
reorganizing this repository shortly.

## Access control
You will note a hard-coded API user identity and key at the top of indexHandlers.js.  This is for
your convenience, and will get you started more rapidly, but Integra reserves the right to revoke this
key at a future date.  Please note that the production systems require unique identities and keys

## Please update weekly
This material is continuously and rapidly evolving!  Please be sure to update weekly.
